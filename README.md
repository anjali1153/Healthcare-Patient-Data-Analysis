# Patient Healthcare Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using a real-world healthcare dataset containing 50,000+ records.
The project covers data storage, cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, and visualization, following industry-standard practices.

## The workflow includes:
1. Storing data in MySQL
2. Connect with python
3. Data cleaning & analysis using Python
4. Creating interactive dashboards using Power BI

## Objectives
1. Analyze patient demographics and hospital trends
2. Identify cost patterns and high-expense treatments
3. Study patient stay duration and discharge outcomes
4. Build interactive dashboards for healthcare decision-making

## Dataset Description
Rows: 50,000
Columns: 15

## Tools & Technologies Used
1. Database: MySQL
2. Programming Language: Python
3. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
4. Visualization Tool: Power BI
5. Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Project Workflow
1️) Data Storage (MySQL) :
1. Created database and tables
2. Imported raw healthcare data
3. Performed basic validation using SQL queries

2️) Data Cleaning & Processing (Python)
1. Connect with MYSQL for getting data in python
2. Handled missing values
3. Removed duplicate records
4. Identified and analyzed outliers
5. Converted data types for analysis

3️) Feature Engineering
1. Created meaningful features such as:
2. age_group
3. cost_category
4. stay_type
5. Aggregated cost and stay metrics

4️) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Patient demographics analysis
2. Diagnosis and department trends
3. Cost distribution and outlier analysis
4. Length of stay patterns

5️) Data Visualization (Power BI)
1. Designed multiple interactive dashboards
2. Implemented slicers and KPIs
3. Created business-focused insights

## Power BI Dashboards

## Healthcare Overview Dashboard
1. Total Patients
2. Total & Average Treatment Cost
3. Diagnosis-wise patient count
4. Gender and hospital distribution
5. Year-wise admissions trend

## Key Insights
1. Certain departments contribute significantly to total treatment cost
2. Emergency admissions generally have higher treatment costs
3. Senior citizens show longer average hospital stays
4. Insurance type impacts treatment affordability

## Skills Demonstrated
1. SQL & Database Management
2. Python Data Analysis (Pandas, NumPy)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Power BI Dashboard Design
6. Data Storytelling
7. End-to-End Project Execution

## Future Improvements
1. Add predictive modeling for patient stay duration
2. Automate data refresh using Power BI Service
3. Include KPI-based alerting
4. Deploy dashboards for real-time monitoring

## This project reflects real-world healthcare data challenges and demonstrates the ability to convert raw data into actionable business insights using modern analytics tools.
